# HR Analysis
This project contains a script responsible for implementing SVM, Neural Networks and Na√Øve Bayes with three different datasets: the original one, the one which contains only features selected by RELIEF algorithm and the one that has PCA components. For each run, the script prints average error, recall and precision for comparison.
